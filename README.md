### Hi there 👋

I'm Razvan Sandu, a Software Developer Engineer at Amazon Web Services (AWS) with a passion for problem-solving and learning new technologies. Please note that my GitHub profile may look quite dry, as most of my recent work is stored in internal gits. My public GitHub repositories mostly contain older university projects and some personal work. Welcome to my GitHub profile!

🔭 Currently working at Amazon Web Services as a Software Developer Engineer, where I contribute to the development and optimization of CloudFront services.

🌱 Previously, I've been a Senior Software Engineer at NetRom, working with Android SDK, Angular, .NET Core, and SQL Server to build seamless logistics systems.

👨‍💻 Mentored and reviewed code for Android projects as a Technical Mentor & Code Reviewer at Udacity, helping students enhance their skills and achieve their learning goals.

💬 I believe in asking not about what languages or frameworks I know, but whether I can solve your problem. My goal is to say "yes" to any challenge!

📫 Feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/SKREFI).

⚡ Fun fact: I was a Human Resources Generalist volunteer at Uniunea Studenților din România, representing students' interests and managing recruitment processes.
